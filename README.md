# DSCI 510 - Final Project - Correlation between Government Policies and the Spread of COVID-19

# Introduction

The project aims to explore the relationship between government policy responses and the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in China by means of correlation and regression analysis. It also seeks to find out which policy contributes most to epidemic prevention. It will combine government action indices from OxCGRT and COVID-19 confirmed cases/deaths from OWID dataset to pursue such analysis and visualize it using heatmaps and line chart.

# Dependencies

> A list of all of the dependencies used, included their version number  
Preferably you should put this information in the `requirements.txt` file but please list it here as well
* Python 3.10
* pandas 1.5.1

# Installation

How to install the requirements necessary to run your project:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Sources

* data source 1: url = "https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv" 
* data source 2: url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/master/data/OxCGRT_nat_latest.csv"

# Running the project

Typically, a single file is called to run the project (something along the lines of)  

```
python src/main.py
```

# Methodology

> What kind of analyses or visualizations did you do? (Similar to Homework 2 Q3, but now you should answer based on your progress, rather than just your plan)  

## Correlation Analysis

### Conclusion

Total deaths and total cases have significant positive impacts on the government response level, containment and health policies, and economic support level.

### Methods
The analysis uses Pearson r to calculate linear correlation coefficients and p-values between indexes. All p<0.05 pairs are reported in the following table with the format of (coefficient, p-value). High-correlated pairs are highlighted as red cells.

## Visualization 1: Cumulative Confirmed Covid Deaths Worldwide Heatmap - Generated by Plotly

<img width="1435" alt="Heatmap of Cummulative Covid Deaths Overworld" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111823275/206635045-8b5585ce-df64-4f44-8fd0-4d20b6eb63ab.png">

### Introduction

The heatmap displays cumulative covid deaths in the world, discretely colored by the number of deaths. It highlights countries significantly suffering from the epidemic and explores the geographical distribution pattern.

### Data Source

The code extracts up-to-date Covid data from Our World in Data (from 2020/02/24 till now) and then generates a heat map displaying the total confirmed deaths and cases worldwide.

### Methods

It uses Plotly to generate the heatmap. It matches the data frame with ISO-A3 geojson format to visualize the distribution of the covid deaths geographically.

## Visualization 2: b.	Interactive Line Growth Chart of Government Response Index Overworld- Generated by bokeh

### Introduction

The line chart visualizes the time series data of the Government Response Index in 10 countries from 2020/01/02 till now. It shows a shared pattern in the changing of government response between different countries in some periods. For example, from 2020/02/28 to 2020/04/09, all countries significantly strengthened epidemic prevention policies simultaneously.

### Data Source

The code extract government policy data from COVID-19 Government Response Tracker.

### Methods

It uses bokeh to generate the interactive line chart. Clicking the legend label allows hiding a specific line. It displays country, date, and government response index as the mouse hovers over the lines. 

# Future Work

> Given more time, what is the direction that you would want to take this project in?  

# Declaration
* Taiwan is not counted as part of China according to the dataset.
* You may get yesterday’s data instead of today’s due to daily updates in the dataset. This usually happens in the morning.
